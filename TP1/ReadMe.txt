Use : while in a terminal, using the command jar and the name_of_jar_file, the first argument should be the path of the folder that is analysed. The second one, should be the extension that we want to analyse (ex: .java, .py, .c, etc)(Note : only .jave works in that implementation). The third argument, is the path were the resulting file should be stored. More than a third argument will be ignored. Once the programme is done running, two .csv files are created in the indicated by the third argument. One name classes.csv contains all the metrics for the class files and the paquets.csv all the metrics for the pakages in the path indicated by the first argument.
